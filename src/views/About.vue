However, information based on social sharing and search engine queries can be misleading and should not be relied on exclusively. Instead, health institutions are combining data from these sources with traditional medical data sets, and utilising medical expertise while analyzing trends. Data analytics, epidemic spread modeling, data simulation related to the global COVID-19 outbreak. The goal is to turn data into information and information into a useful insight. We encourage you to use the governmental sources of data apply statistical and machine learning techniques to identify trends and make valuable assumptions.'},
